# u_store - flattened immutable state


[Counter and Todo Demo](https://robertpage.github.io/u_store/)


This library flattens JSON to make it easier and safer to work with immutable state. This is a very simple (less than 1kb gzipped) library for flattening and then managing that flattened stated. The only part of the JSON object that isn't flat are arrays that have the keys to the former array values.


## To look at the code
